# COMMA.records Brand Voice & Tone

This document defines how COMMA.records should "sound" across the storefront: product copy, artist
bios, blog teasers, CTAs, and microcopy. Use it when writing or editing text in the theme.

## 1. Voice Principles

COMMA.’s voice is:

- **Progressive** – forward-looking, focused on new horizons in music and culture.
- **Minimal** – economical with words; no unnecessary fluff.
- **Evocative** – uses sensory and emotional language to describe sound, space, and atmosphere.
- **Grounded** – honest, clear, and free of hype or cliché.

Whenever you write for COMMA., aim to reflect these four traits.

## 2. Tone by Context

- **Homepage & Hero**
  - Confident and concise.
  - Headlines should set a mood or frame a moment rather than describe everything.
  - Subcopy can add a little more colour, but still stay focused.

- **Artist Bios**
  - Narrative and evocative, but not verbose.
  - Focus on the artist’s sound, influences, and place in the COMMA. universe.
  - Use present tense where possible (“X blends…”, “Y explores…”).

- **Releases & Products**
  - Descriptive and concrete (formats, textures, contexts where the item is used).
  - Convey mood and listening context: late-night drives, club floors, headphones, home listening.

- **Blog / Editorial**
  - Slightly more expansive, but still structured and readable.
  - Mix factual recap (dates, venues, collaborators) with reflective or atmospheric detail.

- **Microcopy (Buttons, Form Text, Errors)**
  - Simple, direct, and human.
  - Avoid jokes or overly clever phrasing that might obscure the action.

## 3. Language Guidelines

- Prefer **plain English** over jargon.
- Use **present tense** where possible.
- Use **active voice**: “COMMA. curates…”, not “is curated by COMMA.”
- Keep sentences relatively short and scannable on both desktop and mobile.
- Avoid exclamation marks unless absolutely necessary.

Words and phrases that feel on-brand:

- Atmosphere, texture, movement, signal, pulse, horizon, deep, spacious, luminous, steady.

Phrases to avoid:

- Generic hype: “the best ever”, “mind-blowing”, “insane drops”.
- Overly corporate language: “synergy”, “leveraging unique value propositions”.

## 4. Patterns & Examples

These examples are illustrative; adjust details for each artist or release.

### 4.1 Homepage Hero

- **Headline**
  - "Progressive sounds from Oslo and beyond."
  - "Deep, spacious club music for late hours."

- **Subcopy**
  - "COMMA. is a label, management, and store curating forward‑thinking house and trance."

- **CTA Labels**
  - "Explore artists"
  - "Listen to the latest release"

### 4.2 Artist Bio (Short)

- "[Artist] blends shimmering trance, deep house, and progressive rhythms built for long-form sets. Their
  work on COMMA. moves between intimate rooms and festival stages, always focused on momentum and mood."

### 4.3 Release Description (Short)

- "Four tracks of slow-building, melodic trance built for warm-up hours and sunrise sets. Rich pads, loose
  percussion, and patiently evolving arrangements keep the floor moving without shouting for attention."

### 4.4 Merch / Lifestyle Product

- "A classic cotton cap with clean embroidery and an adjustable fit. Built for everyday wear – on the way to
  the club, in the studio, or on a quiet day off."

## 5. Structure & Formatting

- Use short paragraphs and clear subheadings in longer content (e.g., About page, blog posts).
- For lists (e.g., tracklists, event details), favour simple bullet or numbered lists.
- On dark backgrounds, avoid long unbroken blocks of text; introduce line breaks and headings.

## 6. Do & Don’t

**Do**

- Describe what the listener will *feel* or *experience*.
- Mention context (clubs, festivals, home listening, headphones, etc.) where helpful.
- Connect artists and releases back to the COMMA. story when appropriate.

**Don’t**

- Overload pages with dense paragraphs.
- Use slang or in-jokes that will age quickly or feel exclusionary.
- Drift into generic marketing speak.
